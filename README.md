### What is this? 
It's a test Vagrant development environment for the manuscript 'Hormonal regulation of salt and water excretion: a mathematical model of whole-kidney function and pressure-natriuresis'
Moss R & Thomas SR. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol, 2013. DOI: 10.1152/ajprenal.00089.2013

### Where is the publication?


### How do I see the results and work with the code?
First install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), then do:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/uomsystemsbiology/rgm_kidney_vagrant.git
$ cd rgm_kidney_vagrant
$ vagrant up
```
This will get the code for this project and build a virtual environment.
